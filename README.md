# Step 8: Reflections

Reflections:
From this analysis, we see that both Linear Regression and Random Forest perform reasonably well in predicting diamond prices.
However, Random Forest provides better performance in terms of R² and error metrics, suggesting it captures non-linear relationships in the data.
In terms of personal insights, this assignment helped me understand the importance of data preprocessing (e.g., scaling, encoding) and how machine learning models behave on real-world datasets like diamonds. Visualization was a critical tool for detecting potential relationships and distributions.

I have also learned a lot about how different features of diamonds, such as carat, clarity, and cut, affect the price. The Random Forest model provided the best performance with an R² score much higher than Linear Regression. The feature importance plot gave me a clear understanding that carat is by far the most important feature in predicting price.

Moreover, the heatmap helped me visualize the relationships between different features, and I noticed that price has a strong positive correlation with carat.
Personally, I learned how important data preprocessing is, especially when working with categorical features and how models like Random Forest can provide insights into feature importance. This assignment has been a fun and insightful journey into machine learning and data analysis.
